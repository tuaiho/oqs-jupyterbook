    "## Final project: Pauli twirling\n",
    "\n",
    "Pauli twirling, also known as randomized compiling, is a common step applied before many noise mitigation techniques used in the field of quantum computing. With Pauli twirling it is possible to tailor general noise channels into a stochastic Pauli channels, which have a relatively simple model, while at the same time keeping the logical circuit unchanged.\n",

    "In this final project, we will explore the effect of Pauli twirling on the different noise channels that we have covered in the course, implement a custom experiment class to be used in conjunction with other qiskit-experiments classes and simulate the effect of Pauli twirling on the noise channels."

Your analysis class could inherit from `BaseAnalysis` and implement the `_run_analysis` method to average the results over different twirls obtained from the experiment. You can use the instructions on the [qiskit-experiments Documentation](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/experiments/tutorials/custom_experiment.html) for help.
